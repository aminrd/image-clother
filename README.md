# image-clother
A Google Chrome extension: Put clothes to images on HTML pages. Google Chrome, has a built-in feature not to load images on a web page. However, user doesn't have any idea about what are the images on that page. It also sometimes ruins the arrangements of the page's UI elements. Image-Clother, on the other hand, doesn't save network traffic, but instead but a cover on all images in a HTML page using related colors in that image by processing all images in that web page.
